# TextBasedGame
While reading the book 'Learn Python the Hard Way' from Zed A. Shaw, I decided to implement
a text-based game like Zork, with text outputs based on the player's choices. It's an example
given by the author so as to familiarize the student with OOP concepts in Python language.
The game involves an engine that runs a map full of scenes. Each Scene will print its own description when the player enters it and then tell the engine what scene to load next out of the map.

Our Character wakes up behind the steering wheel of a speeding car. Immediate action needs to be taken, while nothing seems to make any sense...
